■ Project Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing hospital performance, patient demographics, and financial indicators to extract actionable insights. The dashboard aims to simplify complex healthcare data into an intuitive and interactive interface that helps hospital management make informed, data-driven decisions. The project was designed to answer critical operational and financial questions such as which hospitals perform best, which conditions are most common, and how patient stay durations and insurance types impact overall billing. The analysis combines efficiency, accuracy, and visual storytelling to bring healthcare analytics to life through Power BI.

■ Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis contains over 55,000 records with multiple healthcare-related attributes, including patient details, admission types, insurance providers, billing amounts, and department information.

Two additional columns were derived to enhance the analytical depth:
- Length of Stay → Calculated using (Discharge Date - Admission Date).
- Age Group → Categorized age ranges for demographic analysis.




■ Dashboard Components
The dashboard is structured into two major sections: hospital performance metrics and patient demographic analysis.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Total Patients
- Average Stay (Days)
- Total Billing Amount
- Top Insurance Provider

Main Visualizations:
1. Patients by Medical Condition
2. Patients by Age Group
3. Billing Amount by Hospital
4. Billing Trend by Month
5. Top 10 High-Cost Patients
6. Admission Type Distribution
7. Insurance Type vs Billing
8. Department Performance Overview

■ Tools & Techniques Used
The project was developed entirely in Microsoft Power BI, using advanced features like DAX functions, calculated columns, and card visuals.
The DAX expressions helped build dynamic KPIs that automatically respond to filters and selections. The visuals were formatted consistently using aligned layouts, color balance, and readability optimization.

Key skills demonstrated: Data Cleaning, Data Modeling, DAX Calculations, KPI Creation, and Dashboard Design.

■ How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open the Power BI file.
2. Load the dataset in Power BI Desktop.
3. Apply the DAX measures provided in the “DAX_Measures.docx” file.
4. Use the slicers and filters to explore data interactively.
5. Resize visuals or adjust layout if needed for different screen dimensions.

■ Insights & Value
This dashboard gives healthcare professionals and administrators a 360° view of hospital operations. It highlights areas where efficiency can be improved, departments that are performing well, and segments that drive higher billing or patient volume.
It turns raw healthcare data into a visual performance summary that can help improve patient experience, hospital management, and financial outcomes.
